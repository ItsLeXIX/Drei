# Customer Database Application

This is a simple web application for managing a customer database. It's built with HTML, Python, and JavaScript, and it uses jQuery for DOM manipulation and event handling.

## Features

- **Display Customer Data**: The application displays a list of customers in a table. Each row in the table represents a customer, and each column represents a field of the customer data.

- **Sort by Last Name**: Users can sort the customer list by last name in ascending order.

- **Filter by Subscription Year**: Users can filter the customer list to only show customers who subscribed in a specific year. The available options are 2020, 2021, and 2022.

## Usage

To use the application, you need to have Python and Flask installed on your machine. Once you have these prerequisites, follow these steps:

1. Open Terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory containing `app.py` using the `cd` command.
3. Run the command `python app.py` to start the Flask server.
4. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`.

The customer data will be loaded and displayed in a table. Use the "Sort by Last Name" button to sort the customer list, and use the dropdown menu to filter the customer list.
